# Tree Data Structure 🌳

### About 📖

We've already learned about [Binary Search Trees (BSTs)](https://github.com/nightrunner4/binary-search-trees), a type of tree data structure where each node can have at most two children, and the values of the nodes are ordered.

In a generic data tree that condition is not necesarily true, and I also wanted to learn about them.

### Description 📚

This repo implements a Tree Data Structure in TypeScript, with some methods to modify and traverse the tree.

### Resources Used 💡
